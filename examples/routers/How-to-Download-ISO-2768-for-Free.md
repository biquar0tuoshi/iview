ISO 2768 is a standard that specifies general tolerances for dimensions of workpieces that are produced by metal removal or are formed from sheet metal. It is intended to simplify drawing indications and reduce the number of tolerance notes on drawings. ISO 2768 has two parts: ISO 2768-1 for linear and angular dimensions, and ISO 2768-2 for geometrical tolerances.

However, there is a way to get a preview of ISO 2768 without paying anything. You can use the ISO/AWI 2768 document, which is a draft version of the standard that is still under development. ISO/AWI stands for "Approved Work Item", which means that the document has been approved by the relevant technical committee but has not yet been published as a final standard.
 
The ISO/AWI 2768 document is available for free on the ISO website[^2^]. You can view it online or download it as a PDF file. However, you should be aware that this document is not the same as the final version of ISO 2768 and may contain errors or inconsistencies. It is also subject to change or withdrawal at any time. Therefore, you should not use it for any official or commercial purposes.
 
If you want to get the latest and most accurate version of ISO 2768, you will have to buy it from the ISO website or from an authorized distributor. The current price of ISO 2768-1 is CHF 58 (about USD 63) and the current price of ISO 2768-2 is CHF 88 (about USD 95). You can also buy both parts together as a package for CHF 118 (about USD 127).
 
ISO 2768 is a useful standard for simplifying drawing indications and specifying general tolerances for dimensions of workpieces. However, it is not available for free download and you will have to pay to access it legally. Alternatively, you can use the ISO/AWI 2768 document as a preview, but you should be careful not to rely on it for any official or commercial purposes.
